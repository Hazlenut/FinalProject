Changes we made from the presentation comments:

we made major changes to the eventview

	- most importantly, there is now a listview showing all the events
	- Changed around the class structure and changed the file structure

		now we use an eventdata directory and a userdata directory

	- users now have usernames and passwords instead of only userids
	- we also improved the GUI and user log in system and added a bunch of other minor improvements
	- cleaned up the code a bit
