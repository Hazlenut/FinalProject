We are building a JavaFX application that can get movie times, concert times, sport event times, and more from the internet and store them in the application. The user can then use the application to orgnaize these events.

- added Events.java which is designed to get movie times off a specified movie theater website

- added Movie.java to store the movie data

- added Main.java that contains JavaFX GUI code

- Test.java is temporary

12/3/2019:

- Added the Attributes class to load / save attributes & settings of the program, like the title and whether or not events have already been loaded in

- Added the Event class which both stores event data and collects the data from the web using the jsoup API

- Added the EventLibrary class which stores all events and provides methods for accessing certain subsets of the events (like a List<Event> which only contains movies, etc.)

- Added the EventType enum which is used to label an event object as a particular type - MOVIE, CONCERT, etc.

- Added the abstract View class which serves as the common class holding together the hierarchy of View objects like EventView, SearchView, etc., that form the main GUI system

- Added the EventView class, a View object that is used to store a list of Events and display them in an adjacent GridPane display

- Added the SearchView class, a View object which has a web browser that can be used to search the internet and add events to the EventLibrary

- Added the SettingsView class, a View object which is used to display / alter user settings

- Added the Screen class which loads up the JavaFX GUI and holds all of the individual View instances added to it as well as the the ButtonBar toolbar

- Modified the code within Main.java to fit the new classes which have been added
